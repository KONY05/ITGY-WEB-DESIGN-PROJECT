        <!-- How It Works -->
        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p><strong>Creating an Account and Logging In:</strong> To get started, users must create an account, providing basic information such as their name, email, and phone number. This helps verify user identities and ensure report accuracy. Once registered, users can log in to access the platform’s features.</p>
            <p><strong>Report Submission:</strong> When a user witnesses a suspicious activity, they can initiate a report by clicking the "Report" button. The platform then guides them through a submission form to ensure they provide complete and accurate information. Users also provide a brief description of the incident, outlining what they observed and any other pertinent details. Users can manually enter the location or use GPS for automatic location tagging, ensuring reports are location-specific. The system allows users to categorize incidents (e.g., terrorism, robbery, kidnapping) so authorities can quickly identify and respond to high-priority events. Users can upload photos, videos, or audio recordings to give authorities more context and details on the situation</p>
            <p><strong>Setting Urgency and Time Sensitivity:</strong> Users mark the report’s urgency, distinguishing time-sensitive issues from general concerns. This helps prioritize cases that may require immediate intervention. Users indicate whether the incident is happening in real-time or occurred in the past. This helps authorities respond based on the timeline and urgency of each report.</p>
            <p><strong>Crowdsourced Verification:</strong> Once submitted, the report becomes visible to other users in the vicinity. Community members can verify the incident or provide additional insights, which helps authorities gauge the report’s credibility. Verified reports receive higher priority, enabling a crowdsourced approach to confirm the validity of incidents.</p>
            <p><strong>Immediate Emergency Contact Option:</strong> For emergencies, the platform includes a prominent "Emergency Call" button that connects users directly to local law enforcement or emergency services. This feature allows witnesses to quickly get help in critical situations while submitting their report.</p>

        <!-- Frequently Asked Questions -->
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p><strong>Is my personal information secure on Alertnet?</strong><br> Yes, we prioritize user privacy and data security. Your personal information is stored securely on our servers and is only accessible by authorized personnel. We use encryption and other security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access</p>
            <p><strong>Can I submit a report anonymously?</strong><br> Currently, users are required to register and log in to submit reports. This ensures accountability and prevents misuse of the platform. However, your identity remains confidential and is not shared publicly unless required by law.</p>
            <p><strong>How do I verify someone else's report?</strong><br> If you see a report that matches an incident you witnessed or have additional details about, you can add your own observations or verify the accuracy of the report. This verification helps authorities prioritize credible incidents and builds community trust.</p>
            <p><strong>Can I delete a report after submitting it?</strong><br> Yes, you can delete a report if you realize it’s no longer relevant or necessary. However, this option is only available for a limited time, and frequent deletions may result in limited access to the platform.</p>
